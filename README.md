In this mini-project, a hypothetical staff created. Basic CRUD processes can be done with this API.

FluentValidation is used. One controller has its own Validator (which means if there were 2 controllers, it has to be separated Validator because of the SOLID principles.)

FluentValidation has no Date Build-in-Method. So, custom attribute is created. 

ScreenShots can be found in the project.
